    Since there is no specific parameter for averaging op, we couldn't apply
    averaging quantizer to the averaging op. We have two options:
    1. we perform our own average as sum first then multiply with the
       inversion
       of the division factor: sum(x) * quantize(1/pool_area)
    2. first, we call keras version of averaging first: y1 = keras_average(x)
       then multiply it with pool_size^2: y2 = y1 * pool_area
       Last, y3 = y2 * quantize(1/ pool_area)
    3. Improved based on #2, but multiply x with pool_area before averaging
       so that we don't lose precision during averaging. The order now becomes:
       first, multiply x with pool_area: y1 = x * pool_area
       then we call keras version of averaging: y2 = keras_average(y1)
       Last, y3 = y2 * quantize(1/ pool_area)
    4. Since there is sum_pooling operation, another solution is to use
       depthwise_conv2d with kernel weights = 1 to get the pooling sum. In this
       case we don't lose precision due to averaging. However, this solution
       will introduce extra weights to the layer, which might break our code
       elsewhere.

    Since we need to match software and hardware inference numerics, we are now
    using #3 in the implementation.

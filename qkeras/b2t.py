def BinaryToThermometer(
    x, classes, value_range, with_residue=False, merge_with_channels=False,
    use_two_hot_encoding=False):
  """Converts binary to one-hot (with scales).

  Given input matrix x with values (for example) 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, create
  a number of classes as follows:

  classes=2, value_range=8, with_residue=0

  A true one-hot representation, and the remaining bits are truncated, using
  one bit representation.

  0 - [1,0] 1 - [1,0] 2 - [1,0] 3 - [1,0]
  4 - [0,1] 5 - [0,1] 6 - [0,1] 7 - [0,1]

  classes=2, value_range=8, with_residue=1

  In this case, the residue is added to the one-hot class, and the class will
  use 2 bits (for the remainder) + 1 bit (for the one hot)

  0 - [1,0] 1 - [1.25,0] 2 - [1.5,0] 3 - [1.75,0]
  4 - [0,1] 5 - [0,1.25] 6 - [0,1.5] 7 - [0,1.75]

  Arguments:
    x: the input vector we want to convert. typically its dimension will be
      (B,H,W,C) for an image, or (B,T,C) or (B,C) for for a 1D signal, where
      B=batch, H=height, W=width, C=channels or features, T=time for time
      series.
    classes: the number of classes to (or log2(classes) bits) to use of the
      values.
    value_range: max(x) - min(x) over all possible x values (e.g. for 8 bits,
      we would use 256 here).
    with_residue: if true, we split the value range into two sets and add
      the decimal fraction of the set to the one-hot representation for partial
      thermometer representation.
    merge_with_channels: if True, we will not create a separate dimension
      for the resulting matrix, but we will merge this dimension with
      the last dimension.
    use_two_hot_encoding: if true, we will distribute the weight between
      the current value and the next one to make sure the numbers will always
      be < 1.

  Returns:
    Converted x with classes with the last shape being C*classes.

  # we will have the classes 0, 1, 2, where for the number 3, we will

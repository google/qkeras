QKeras 0.8 highlights:

- Automatic quantization using QKeras;

- Stochastic behavior (including stochastic rouding) is disabled during
inference;

- LeakyReLU for quantized_relu;

- Qtools for estimating effort to perform inference;

  * Qtools will estimate the sizes and types of operations to perform inference,
    with its data sizes compatible with high-level synthesis datatypes. For
    example, quantized_bits and quantized_relu bits and int_bits from Qtools
    will match exactly ac_fixed datatypes (if you rely on QKeras alone, the
    correct datatype should be ac_fixed\<bits, int_bits+is_negative,
    is_negative\>, where is_negative has to be inferred from the other
    parameters of the quantizer.


## Introduction

QKeras is a quantization extension to Keras that provides drop-in
replacement for some of the Keras layers, especially the ones that
creates parameters and activation layers, and perform arithmetic
operations, so that we can quickly create a deep quantized version of
Keras network.

According to Tensorflow documentation, Keras is a high-level API to
build and train deep learning models. It's used for fast prototyping,
advanced research, and production, with three key advantages:

- User friendly

Keras has a simple, consistent interface optimized for common use
cases. It provides clear and actionable feedback for user errors.

- Modular and composable

Keras models are made by connecting configurable building blocks
together, with few restrictions.

- Easy to extend

Write custom building blocks to express new ideas for research. Create
new layers, loss functions, and develop state-of-the-art models.

QKeras is being designed to extend the functionality of Keras using
Keras' design principle, i.e. being user friendly, modular and
extensible, adding to it being "minimally intrusive" of Keras native
functionality.

In order to successfully quantize a model, users need to replace
variable creating layers (Dense, Conv2D, etc) by their counterparts
(QDense, QConv2D, etc), and any layers that perform math operations
need to be quantized afterwards.

## Layers Implemented in QKeras

- QDense

- QConv1D

- QConv2D

- QDepthwiseConv2D

- QSeparableConv1D (depthwise + pointwise convolution, without
quantizing the activation values after the depthwise step)

- QSeparableConv2D (depthwise + pointwise convolution, without
quantizing the activation values after the depthwise step)

- QMobileNetSeparableConv2D (extended from MobileNet SeparableConv2D
implementation, quantizes the activation values after the depthwise step)

- QConv2DTranspose

- QActivation

- QAdaptiveActivation [EXPERIMENTAL]

- QAveragePooling2D (in fact, an AveragePooling2D stacked with a 
QActivation layer for quantization of the result)

- QBatchNormalization (is still in its experimental stage, as we
have not seen the need to use this yet due to the normalization 
and regularization effects of stochastic activation functions.)

- QOctaveConv2D

- QSimpleRNN, QSimpleRNNCell

- QLSTM, QLSTMCell

- QGRU, QGRUCell

- QBidirectional

It is worth noting that not all functionality is safe at this time to
be used with other high-level operations, such as with layer
wrappers. For example, Bidirectional layer wrappers are used with
RNNs.  If this is required, we encourage users to use quantization
functions invoked as strings instead of the actual functions as a way
through this, but we may change that implementation in the future.

A first attempt to create a safe mechanism in QKeras is the adoption
of QActivation is a wrap-up that provides an encapsulation around the
activation functions so that we can save and restore the network
architecture, and duplicate them using Keras interface, but this
interface has not been fully tested yet.

## Activation Layers Implemented in QKeras

- smooth_sigmoid(x)

- hard_sigmoid(x)

- binary_sigmoid(x)

- binary_tanh(x)

- smooth_tanh(x)

- hard_tanh(x)

- quantized_bits(bits=8, integer=0, symmetric=0, keep_negative=1)(x)

- bernoulli(alpha=1.0)(x)

- stochastic_ternary(alpha=1.0, threshold=0.33)(x)

- ternary(alpha=1.0, threshold=0.33)(x)

- stochastic_binary(alpha=1.0)(x)

- binary(alpha=1.0)(x)

- quantized_relu(bits=8, integer=0, use_sigmoid=0, negative_slope=0.0)(x)

- quantized_ulaw(bits=8, integer=0, symmetric=0, u=255.0)(x)

- quantized_tanh(bits=8, integer=0, symmetric=0)(x)

- quantized_po2(bits=8, max_value=-1)(x)

- quantized_relu_po2(bits=8, max_value=-1)(x)

The stochastic_* functions, bernoulli as well as quantized_relu and
quantized_tanh rely on stochastic versions of the activation
functions. They draw a random number with uniform distribution from
_hard_sigmoid of the input x, and result is based on the expected
value of the activation function. Please refer to the papers if you
want to understand the underlying theory, or the documentation in
qkeras/qlayers.py.

The parameters "bits" specify the number of bits for the quantization,
and "integer" specifies how many bits of "bits" are to the left of the
decimal point. Finally, our experience in training networks with
QSeparableConv2D, both quantized_bits and quantized_tanh that
generates values between [-1, 1), required symmetric versions of the
range in order to properly converge and eliminate the bias.

Every time we use a quantization for weights and bias that can
generate numbers outside the range [-1.0, 1.0], we need to adjust the
*_range to the number. For example, if we have a
quantized_bits(bits=6, integer=2) in a weight of a layer, we need to
set the weight range to 2**2, which is equivalent to Catapult HLS
ac_fixed<6, 3, true>. Similarly, for quantization functions that accept an 
alpha parameter, we need to specify a range of alpha,
and for po2 type of quantizers, we need to specify the range of
max_value.


### Example

Suppose you have the following network.

An example of a very simple network is given below in Keras.


```python
from keras.layers import *

x = x_in = Input(shape)
x = Conv2D(18, (3, 3), name="first_conv2d")(x)
x = Activation("relu")(x)
x = SeparableConv2D(32, (3, 3))(x)
x = Activation("relu")(x)
x = Flatten()(x)
x = Dense(NB_CLASSES)(x)
x = Activation("softmax")(x)
```

You can easily quantize this network as follows:

```python
from keras.layers import *
from qkeras import *

x = x_in = Input(shape)
x = QConv2D(18, (3, 3),
        kernel_quantizer="stochastic_ternary",
        bias_quantizer="ternary", name="first_conv2d")(x)
x = QActivation("quantized_relu(3)")(x)
x = QSeparableConv2D(32, (3, 3),
        depthwise_quantizer=quantized_bits(4, 0, 1),
        pointwise_quantizer=quantized_bits(3, 0, 1),
        bias_quantizer=quantized_bits(3),
        depthwise_activation=quantized_tanh(6, 2, 1))(x)
x = QActivation("quantized_relu(3)")(x)
x = Flatten()(x)
x = QDense(NB_CLASSES,
        kernel_quantizer=quantized_bits(3),
        bias_quantizer=quantized_bits(3))(x)
x = QActivation("quantized_bits(20, 5)")(x)
x = Activation("softmax")(x)
```

The last QActivation is advisable if you want to compare results later on. 
Please find more cases under the directory examples.


## QTools
The purpose of QTools is to assist hardware implementation of the quantized
model and model energy consumption estimation. QTools has two functions: data
type map generation and energy consumption estimation.

- Data Type Map Generation:
QTools automatically generate the data type map for weights, bias, multiplier,
adder, etc. of each layer. The data type map includes operation type,
variable size, quantizer type and bits, etc. Input of the QTools is:
1) a given quantized model;
2) a list of input quantizers
for the model. Output of QTools json file that list the data type map of each
layer (stored in qtools_instance._output_dict)
Output methods include: qtools_stats_to_json, which is to output the data type
map to a json file; qtools_stats_print which is to print out the data type map.

- Energy Consumption Estimation:
Another function of QTools is to estimate the model energy consumption in
Pico Joules (pJ). It provides a tool for QKeras users to quickly estimate
energy consumption for memory access and MAC operations in a quantized model
derived from QKeras, especially when comparing power consumption of two models
running on the same device.

As with any high-level model, it should be used with caution when attempting
to estimate the absolute energy consumption of a model for a given technology,
or when attempting to compare different technologies.

This tool also provides a measure for model tuning which needs to consider
both accuracy and model energy consumption. The energy cost provided by this
tool can be integrated into a total loss function which combines energy
cost and accuracy.

- Energy Model:
The best work referenced by the literature on energy consumption was first
computed by Horowitz M.: “1.1 computing’s energy problem (
and what we can do about it)”; IEEE International Solid-State Circuits
Conference Digest of Technical Papers (ISSCC), 2014

In this work, the author attempted to estimate the energy
consumption for accelerators, and for 45 nm process, the data points he
presented has since been used whenever someone wants to compare accelerator
performance. QTools energy consumption on a 45nm process is based on the
data published in this work.

- Examples:
Example of how to generate data type map can be found in qkeras/qtools/
examples/example_generate_json.py. Example of how to generate energy consumption
estimation can be found in qkeras/qtools/examples/example_get_energy.py


## AutoQKeras

AutoQKeras allows the automatic quantization and rebalancing of deep neural
networks by treating quantization and rebalancing of an existing deep neural
network as a hyperparameter search in Keras-Tuner using random search,
hyperband or gaussian processes.

In order to contain the explosion of hyperparameters, users can group tasks by
patterns, and perform distribute training using available resources.

Extensive documentation is present in notebook/AutoQKeras.ipynb.


## Related Work

QKeras has been implemented based on the work of "B.Moons et al. -
Minimum Energy Quantized Neural Networks", Asilomar Conference on
Signals, Systems and Computers, 2017 and "Zhou, S. et al. -
DoReFa-Net: Training Low Bitwidth Convolutional Neural Networks with
Low Bitwidth Gradients," but the framework should be easily
extensible. The original code from QNN can be found below.

https://github.com/BertMoons/QuantizedNeuralNetworks-Keras-Tensorflow

QKeras extends QNN by providing a richer set of layers (including
SeparableConv2D, DepthwiseConv2D, ternary and stochastic ternary
quantizations), besides some functions to aid the estimation for the
accumulators and conversion between non-quantized to quantized
networks. Finally, our main goal is easy of use, so we attempt to make
QKeras layers a true drop-in replacement for Keras, so that users can
easily exchange non-quantized layers by quantized ones.

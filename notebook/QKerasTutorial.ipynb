    "It is worth noting that not all functionality is safe at this time to be used with other high-level operations, such as with layer wrappers. For example, `Bidirectional` layer wrappers are used with RNNs.  If this is required, we encourage users to use quantization functions invoked as strings instead of the actual functions as a way through this, but we may change that implementation in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`QSeparableConv2D`__ is implemented as a depthwise + pointwise quantized expansions, which is extended from the `SeparableConv2D` implementation of MobileNet. With the exception of __`QBatchNormalization`__, if quantizers are not specified, no quantization is applied to the layer and it ends up behaving like the orgininal unquantized layers. On the other hand, __`QBatchNormalization`__ has been implemented differently as if the user does not specify any quantizers as parameters, it uses a set up that has worked best when attempting to implement quantization efficiently in hardware and software, i.e. `gamma` and `variance` with po2 quantizers (as they become shift registers in an implementation, and with further constraining variance po2 quantizer to use quadratic approximation as we take the square root of the variance to obtain the standard deviation), `beta` using po2 quantizer to maintain the dynamic range aspect of the center parameter, and `mean` remaining unquantized, as it inherits the properties of the previous layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation has been migrated to __`QActivation`__ although it __QKeras__ also recognizes activation parameter used in convolutional and dense layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have improved the setup of quantization as convolution, dense and batch normalization layers now notify the quantizers when the quantizers are used as internal parameters, so the user does not need to worry about setting up options that work best in `weights` and `bias` like `alpha` and `use_stochastic_rounding` (although users may override the automatic setup).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in the current version, we have eliminated the need to set up the range of the quantizers like `kernel_range` in __`QDense`__. This is automatically computed internally at this point. Although we kept the parameters for backward compatibility, these parameters will be removed in the future."

    "The __`stochastic_*`__ functions and __`bernoulli`__ rely on stochastic versions of the activation functions, so they are best suited for weights and biases.  They draw a random number with uniform distribution from `sigmoid` of the input x, and result is based on the expected value of the activation function. Please refer to the papers if you want to understand the underlying theory, or the documentation in qkeras/quantizers.py. The parameter `temperature` determines how steep the sigmoid function will behave, and the default values seem to work fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we lower the number of bits, rounding becomes problematic as it adds bias to the number system. Numpy attempt to reduce the effects of bias by rounding to even instead of rounding to infinity. Recent results (_\"Suyog Gupta, Ankur Agrawal, Kailash Gopalakrishnan, Pritish Narayanan; Deep Learning with Limited Numerical Precision_ [https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02551]) suggested using stochastic rounding, which uses the fracional part of the number as a probability to round up or down. We can turn on stochastic rounding in some quantizers by setting `use_stochastic_rounding` to `True` in __`quantized_bits`__, __`binary`__, __`ternary`__, __`quantized_relu`__ and __`quantized_tanh`__, __`quantized_po2`__, and __`quantized_relu_po2`__. Please note that if one is considering an efficient hardware or software implementation, we should avoid setting this flag to `True` in activations as it may affect the efficiency of an implementation. In addition, as mentioned before, we already set this flag to `True` in some quantized layers when the quantizers are used as weights/biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters `bits` specify the number of bits for the quantization, and `integer` specifies how many bits of `bits` are to the left of the decimal point. Finally, our experience in training networks with __`QSeparableConv2D`__, it is advisable to allocate more bits between the depthwise and the pointwise quantization, and both __`quantized_bits`__ and __`quantized_tanh`__ should use symmetric versions for weights and bias in order to properly converge and eliminate the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have substantially improved stochastic rounding implementation in __QKeras__ $>= 0.7$, and added a symbolic way to compute alpha in __`binary`__, __`stochastic_binary`__, __`ternary`__, __`stochastic_ternary`__, __`bernoulli`__ and __`quantized_bits`__. Right now, a scale and the threshold (for ternary and stochastic_ternary) can be computed independently of the distribution of the inputs, which is required when using these quantizers in weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem in using very small bit widths in large deep learning networks stem from the fact that weights are initialized with variance roughly $\\propto \\sqrt{1/\\tt{fanin}}$, but during the training the variance shifts outwards.  If the smallest quantization representation (threshold in ternary networks) is smaller than $\\sqrt{1/\\tt{fanin}}$, we run the risk of having the weights stuck at 0 during training. So, the weights need to dynamically adjust to the variance shift from initialization to the final training.  This can be done by scaling the quantization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scale is computed using the formula $\\sum(\\tt{dot}(Q,x))/\\sum(\\tt{dot}(Q,Q))$ which is described in several papers, including _Mohammad Rastegari, Vicente Ordonez, Joseph Redmon, Ali Farhadi \"XNOR-Net: ImageNet Classification Using Binary Convolutional Neural Networks\"_ [https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05279]. Scale computation is computed for each output channel, making our implementation sometimes behaving like a mini-batch normalization adjustment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For __`ternary`__ and __`stochastic_ternary`__, we iterate between scale computation and threshold computation, as presented in _K. Hwang and W. Sung, \"Fixed-point feedforward deep neural network design using weights +1, 0, and −1,\" 2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS), Belfast, 2014, pp. 1-6_ which makes the search for threshold and scale tolerant to different input distributions. This is especially important when we need to consider that the threshold shifts depending on the input distribution,  affecting the scale as well, as pointed out by _Fengfu Li, Bo Zhang, Bin Liu, \"Ternary Weight Networks\"_ [https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04711]. \n",
    "\n",
    "When computing the scale in these quantizers, if `alpha=\"auto\"`, we compute the scale as a floating point number. If `alpha=\"auto_po2\"`, we enforce the scale to be a power of 2, meaning that an actual hardware or software implementation can be performed by just shifting the result of the convolution or dense layer to the right or left by checking the sign of the scale (positive shifts left, negative shifts right), and taking the log2 of the scale.  This behavior is compatible with shared exponent approaches, as it performs a shift adjustment to the channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have implemented a method for each quantizer called __`_set_trainable_parameter`__ that instructs __QKeras__ to set best options when this quantizer is used as a weight or for gamma, variance and beta in __`QBatchNormalization`__, so in principle, users should not worry about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following pictures show the behavior of __`binary`__ vs stochastic rounding in __`binary`__ vs __`stochastic_binary`__ (Figure 1) and __`ternary`__ vs stochastic rounding in __`ternary`__ and __`stochastic_ternary`__ (Figure 2). We generated a normally distributed input with mean 0.0 and standard deviation of 0.02, ordered the data, and ran the quantizer 1,000 times, averaging the result for each case. Note that because of scale, the output does not range from $[-1.0, +1.0]$, but from $[-\\tt{scale}, +\\tt{scale}]$.\n",
